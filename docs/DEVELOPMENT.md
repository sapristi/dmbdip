# Development

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Rust
- **Terminal:** Kitty (graphics protocol, raw RGB f=24, double-buffered)
- **Key crates:** `image`, `base64`, `crossterm`, `pulldown-cmark`, `ab_glyph`, `imageproc`, `notify-debouncer-mini`
- **Fonts:** DejaVu Sans (regular, bold, oblique) + DejaVu Sans Mono

## Architecture

- Parse markdown into `Vec<Block>` (Heading, Paragraph, CodeBlock, Table, Metadata)
- Inline text uses `Vec<Span>` with styles: Normal, Bold, Italic, Code
- `HeadingInfo` tracks each heading's position, number, fold state
- `AppState` manages blocks, headings, cursor, scroll, fold, search state
- Two-pass rendering: compute height, then draw to RgbImage (re-renders on fold/nav changes)
- Kitty display: double-buffered with alternating image IDs, raw RGB, BufWriter
- Alternate screen mode for proper key passthrough

## Workflow Rules

- Commit changes each time a task is done
- Clean git history if appropriate (squash fixup commits)
- Evaluate quality every few commits and after fixing bugs

## Manual testing

The file docs/sample.md can be used for manual testing
